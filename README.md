# Text-Editor-with-Draft-js-WYSIWYG
a minimal text editor implimentation

as of right now, some functions need to be removed (not sure how to do that, yet)

Functions that don't seem to do much yet:
- Imput (is not user-interactive; it only changes to normal vs blocktype, depending on what kind of formatting is being used.)
- Font Size
- Font
- Link
- Unlink
- Color Picker
- Eraser
- Emoji
- Image
- Embedded
Also, indent's functionality seems to be limited, and could be removed

Functions that seem to work perfectly:
- Bold
- Italic
- Underline
- Strikethrough
- Quote
- Subscript
- SuperScript
- Ordered List
- Unordered List
- Align Right
- Align Left 
- Align Center
- Undo
- Redo
